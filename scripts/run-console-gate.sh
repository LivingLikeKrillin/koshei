# §5 v0.4a GATE (objective proof): the operator console's run-history persistence + list/detail seams are
# real and LIVE on REAL Temporal. After a run, GET /api/runs lists it (persisted in run_index) and the
# existing detail seams (GET /api/runs/{id}, /nodes) answer for it — including a PAST failure's reverse-topo
# compensation lighting, observable after the fact, and a cross-run (newest-first) history.
#   1 recorded+listed : a successful diamond run lands in run_index AND in GET /api/runs.
#   2 detail seams     : GET /api/runs/{id} status + /nodes (all DONE) answer for the recorded run.
#   3 past failure     : a failed run (unique notify.email sink) is recorded; its /nodes shows sink FAILED +
#                        compensable b COMPENSATED (reverse-topo) — observable from the console after the fact.
#   4 cross-run        : GET /api/runs lists BOTH runs, newest-first.
#
# Temporal-only (consistent with run-node-states-gate.sh / run-compose-run-gate.sh — compile stays
# engine-neutral; Conductor run-tracking deferred). Needs Postgres 15432 + Temporal 7233. Bring-up is cloned
# VERBATIM from run-node-states-gate.sh (env, psql_q, JVM launch/kill helpers, cleanup trap, step-0
# schema/reset/seed incl. TRUNCATE workflow_def, worker start + diamond save + poll-bind wait). Only the
# ASSERTIONS differ. Boundary + full prior-gate regression are controller-verified (Task 5.2), not in-script.
#
# Run from repo root with the stack up + v0.1 schema applied:
#   docker compose up -d
#   bash scripts/init-db.sh
#   bash scripts/run-console-gate.sh   # expect: [GATE] PASS run-console-gate.sh ... exit 0
#
# WINDOWS KILL NOTE (REF run-node-states-gate.sh): `./gradlew run` forks a separate JVM; $! is the wrapper PID,
# not the JVM. We resolve the real JVM via `jps` and taskkill by PID.
