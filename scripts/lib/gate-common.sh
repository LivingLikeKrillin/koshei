#
# SOURCE this from a gate script; it defines functions only. It deliberately does NOT set
# `set -euo pipefail`, `cd`, traps, or any side-effecting top-level code — the CALLER owns its
# environment, working directory, and cleanup trap. Guarded against double-source below.
#
# Adoption is incremental: new gates source this library; the older gates
# (run-opcua-gate.sh, run-delegation-gate.sh, run-integration-pov-gate.sh) keep their inline
# helpers and are intentionally left untouched. run-r2-ncmd-gate.sh is the first adopter.

# Include guard: safe to source more than once.

# native_path <path> — echo a native-Windows path that NATIVE tools (docker, native JVMs) accept.

# to e.g. `docker compose -f` becomes an invalid `C:\c\...`. `cygpath -m` yields a Windows path with
# forward slashes that such tools accept. NOTE: `cd "$dir" && <tool>` is immune (it cds, not -f) and
# needs no conversion. Falls back to the input unchanged when cygpath is unavailable (non-MSYS).
