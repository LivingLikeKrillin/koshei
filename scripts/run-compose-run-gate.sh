# §15 v0.3e GATE (objective proof): the OPERATOR workflow compose -> validate -> save(=deploy) -> run-on-
# engine control plane is real and LIVE, and a NEWLY-COMPOSED workflow runs on an ALREADY-RUNNING worker
# WITHOUT a restart (the v0.3e headline: deploy -> background poll-bind -> run, one worker process).
#
# This is the Node-RED-impossible property for v0.3e: an operator composes a brand-new workflow NAME via the
# API, saves it, and it becomes runnable on a long-lived worker via a 3s background poll — no Temporal type
# re-registration, no worker bounce. Run-trigger is Temporal-only (compile stays engine-neutral; Conductor
# run deferred). Needs Postgres 15432 + Temporal 7233 (real workflow execution).
#
# Five hard asserts (ALL must hold for PASS):
#   1 validate : cycle.json -> valid:false + diagnostic; unwired.json -> valid:false; diamond.json ->
#                valid:true with nodeCount==5.
#   2 save+immut : POST diamond@1.0.0 -> 200; workflow_def has exactly 1 row for diamond@1.0.0; re-POST -> 400.
#   3 ★ poll-bind+run (NO worker restart): worker was started BEFORE the workflow existed; after one poll
#                interval the worker log shows `[worker] bound workflow diamond@1.0.0`; run diamond -> the
#                GET .../run?wait=true completed boolean is true; target_rows count > 0 (the composed sink wrote).
#   4 human-gate : save+run gated.json (ends in IRREVERSIBLE actuate); GET .../runs shows RUNNING (parked at
#                the approval gate); approve -> wait=true completed:true.
#   5 boundary : built :core/:registry/:compiler/:dispatch jars carry 0 org.springframework (Spring confined
#                to :authoring-api edge — the v0.3d assert, unchanged).
