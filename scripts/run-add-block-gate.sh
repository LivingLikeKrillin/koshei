# §15 v0.2 GATE (objective proof): an EXTERNAL engineer's block jar is published, resolved from the
# hybrid registry, isolation-loaded under a child URLClassLoader, and RUN inside a Temporal saga.
#   This is the Node-RED-impossible property for v0.2: a third-party plugin enters the platform through
#   a contract+jar (not a code edit) and executes with classloader isolation + durable orchestration.
#
# Three trivial-pass blockers (must ALL hold for PASS):
#   (a) EXECUTION : worker log shows `[plugin] forward io.example.greet` (the plugin's forward ran;
#                   only the plugin path prints this).
#   (b) ISOLATION : worker log shows `[PluginLoader] loaded io.example.GreetBlock via ...URLClassLoader...`
#                   (the plugin class was loaded by a child loader, NOT the system loader).
#   (c) DURABILITY: the workflow reaches completed=true.
# Plus a HARD pre-assert: the DB block_index has exactly one row for io.example.greet#1.0.0 AND the
# content-addressed jar artifact exists under the shared plugin dir.
#
# Run from repo root with the stack up + v0.1 schema applied:
#   docker compose up -d
#   bash scripts/init-db.sh
#   bash scripts/run-add-block-gate.sh   # expect: [GATE] PASS ... exit 0
#
# WINDOWS KILL NOTE (REF run-crash-recovery.sh): `./gradlew run` forks a separate JVM (koshei.app.WorkerKt);
# $! is the wrapper PID, not the JVM. We resolve the real JVM via `jps` and taskkill by PID.
