# merge -> db.upsert sink. We slow ONLY transform.map (slowAtBlockId) by SLOW_MS each. We measure the window
# from the FIRST "forward transform.map" marker to the "forward db.upsert" (sink) marker:
#   - CONCURRENT: all 3 branches enter ~together at t0, drain at t0+SLOW_MS, merge, sink enters ~t0+SLOW_MS
#                 -> window ~= 1*SLOW_MS.

#                 ~t0+3*SLOW_MS -> window ~= 3*SLOW_MS.

#  cases and would NOT discriminate.) Worker-log markers are immune to per-call gradle overhead (see
