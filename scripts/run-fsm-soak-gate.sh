# R4 Soak-Window + Auto-Rollback gate (objective proof): a canary deploy can enter a SOAKING window
# instead of promoting immediately; failures reported during the window accumulate a fail_count, and
# a periodic sweep (koshei.registry.SoakSupervisor.sweep, driven in prod by authoring-api's
# SoakSupervisorBean @Scheduled) either AUTO_ROLLBACKs a soaking deployment that hit its fail
# threshold, or PROMOTEs one that survived past soak_until untouched. This gate drives the SAME
# supervisor via the Git-native :app fsm CLI subcommands (deploy --soak-seconds/--fail-threshold,
# report-failure, soak-sweep, status) — no server needed; the CLI opens its own DB connection per
# invocation (koshei.blocks.Db, KOSHEI_DB_URL/USER/PASS).
#
# SERVER-LESS: unlike run-fsm-canary-gate.sh (which boots sim+worker+authoring-api because it drives
# a REAL governed OPC-UA run), this gate only needs Postgres + the :app fsm CLI. No sim, no worker,
# no API, no OPC-UA I/O.
#
#   T1  auto-rollback : deploy v1 (rollback target) -> deploy v2 soaking (threshold 2) -> 2 reported
#                       failures (>= threshold) -> sweep -> AUTO_ROLLBACK line1 v2 -> v1; active=v1;
#                       status=promoted (rollback target is not itself "soaking"); audit row written.
#   T2  promote       : deploy v1 -> deploy v2 soaking (1s window) -> sleep past soak_until -> sweep
#                       -> PROMOTE line1 v2; active stays v2; status=promoted.
#   T3  no-op         : deploy v1 -> deploy v2 soaking (long window, threshold 2) -> 1 reported failure
#                       (below threshold) -> sweep -> "no soak actions"; status stays soaking
#                       fail_count=1/2; active stays v2 (nothing flipped).
#   T4  reject        : deploy v2 --soak-seconds with NO prior deployed version for the unit is
#                       refused (a soak needs a known rollback target); pointer stays unset.
#   T5  regression    : OPT-IN (SOAK_GATE_RUN_CANARY=1). The R4 canary+instant-rollback gate
#                       (run-fsm-canary-gate.sh) boots its own full sim+worker+authoring-api stack and
#                       drives governed Temporal runs, so it is slow; chaining it here would push the
#                       total past a single harness run window. By DEFAULT T5 is SKIPPED and the canary
#                       regression is verified by running run-fsm-canary-gate.sh SEPARATELY (its own
#                       [GATE] PASS). Set SOAK_GATE_RUN_CANARY=1 to chain it inline (~10+ extra min).
#
# KOSHEI_SOAK_DISABLED=1 is exported so that IF an authoring-api happened to be running against the
# same DB it would not race this gate's manual sweeps (defense-in-depth; this gate does not start
# authoring-api itself).
#
# Run from repo root:
#   bash scripts/run-fsm-soak-gate.sh                         # T1-T4 (new soak behaviour) -> [GATE] PASS
#   SOAK_GATE_RUN_CANARY=1 bash scripts/run-fsm-soak-gate.sh  # also chain the canary regression (slow)
