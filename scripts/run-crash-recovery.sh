# §9.2 crash-recovery objective proof (DoD #2): kill the worker WHILE the db.upsert activity is in
# flight, restart, and prove the workflow still completes with a consistent final state. This is the
# core Node-RED-impossible property: durable state survives process death.
#   PRIMARY signal  : workflow reaches completed=true even though the worker running it was killed
#                     mid-activity -> state lived OUTSIDE the worker (Temporal); a fresh worker resumed.
#   SECONDARY signal: final state is consistent despite Temporal's at-least-once activity retry
#                     -> idempotent UPSERT converged (exactly one row, value "X"). The
#                        "idempotency makes at-least-once safe" thesis, not the recovery itself.

# WINDOWS KILL NOTE: `./gradlew --no-daemon run` forks a separate JVM (mainClass koshei.app.WorkerKt)
# from the wrapper. $! is the wrapper PID, NOT the JVM. We therefore resolve the actual JVM PID via
# `jps` and taskkill it by PID, then verify with jps that none survive. This makes the mid-activity
# kill meaningful (the JVM running the activity really died) and proves recovery is by a FRESH process.
