/**
 * Pure decision core for auto-correct auto-dispatch (design 2026-07-04). Every effect is an injected lambda, so
 * this is deterministically unit-testable with NO DB/Temporal — the AutoCorrectSupervisor idiom. Two phases,
 * order matters: (1) reconcile finished corrections FIRST so a just-completed one can't block a new drift's
 * dispatch; (2) dedup-guarded dispatch — never start a correction while one is already PENDING for the unit.
